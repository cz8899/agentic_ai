Why this Matters for Large Banks

NIST CSF 2.0 → provides global cybersecurity baseline functions.

MITRE ATLAS → gives AI-specific adversarial tactics to test against.

SR 11-7 (Fed) → requires model risk governance, making AI security part of regulatory obligations.

DORA (EU) → enforces operational resilience, including AI workloads.

EU AI Act → imposes legal requirements on high-risk AI (finance is explicitly in scope).

Together, these ensure compliance, resilience, trustworthiness, and supervisory confidence, while providing measurable controls for AI cyber risk.
