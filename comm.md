Subject: Follow-Up: Well-Architected Framework for DevOps Teams

Hi Melonie,

I hope you’re doing well.

I wanted to follow up on our recent meeting regarding the use of the Well-Architected Framework to support and empower our DevOps teams at different maturity levels.

Attached, you’ll find a worksheet that includes specific questions and proposed answers from the Well-Architected DevOps Lens. I’d greatly appreciate your review and feedback on these items. Your input will be valuable in refining the approach before we expand the discussion with our risk partners and cyber architecture colleagues.

Thank you for your time and guidance, and I look forward to your thoughts.
