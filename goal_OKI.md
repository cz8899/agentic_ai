AI Cybersecurity Goals & OKRs Framework
1. Identify

Goal: Establish full visibility and governance over AI systems, data flows, and regulatory alignment.

OKR 1.1: By Q???, achieve 100% inventory of all AI/ML models, datasets, and third-party MCPs.

OKR 1.2: Implement model risk tiering aligned to SR 11-7 and EU AI Act by Q???.

OKR 1.3: Conduct annual AI regulatory compliance audit with zero critical findings.

2. Protect

Goal: Harden AI assets, contextual memory, and pipelines against misuse, tampering, and insider/external threats.

OKR 2.1: By Q???, enforce role-based Zero Trust access across all AI infrastructure (100% of AI workloads covered).

OKR 2.2: Achieve ≥95% encryption coverage of AI contextual memory and prompt logs by default.

OKR 2.3: Deploy automated model watermarking & integrity checks across all Tier-1 models by year-end.

3. Detect

Goal: Enable advanced observability to identify adversarial AI attacks, drift, or misuse in real time.

OKR 3.1: Deploy MCP and contextual memory monitoring with anomaly detection across 100% of production AI services by Q???.

OKR 3.2: Achieve <15 minutes mean time to detect (MTTD) for adversarial prompts or data poisoning attempts.

OKR 3.3: Implement MITRE ATLAS-aligned AI threat detection playbooks covering at least 80% of known TTPs.

4. Respond

Goal: Ensure rapid, coordinated containment of AI incidents with cross-domain intelligence and red-teaming.

OKR 4.1: By Q???, integrate AI red-team findings into incident response tabletop exercises quarterly.

OKR 4.2: Maintain ≥90% of AI incident response runbooks aligned with NIST CSF and DORA timelines.

OKR 4.3: Achieve <60 minutes mean time to respond (MTTR) to AI-related cyber incidents.

5. Recover

Goal: Build resilience to AI disruptions, adversarial attacks, and regulatory scrutiny.

OKR 5.1: Establish AI disaster recovery and failover for all Tier-1 AI systems with ≤4 hours RTO and ≤15 minutes RPO.

OKR 5.2: Conduct bi-annual resilience testing of contextual memory and model rollbacks against adversarial corruption.

OKR 5.3: Demonstrate recovery compliance with DORA resilience mandates in independent audit with zero major findings.

Strategic Alignment

NIST CSF 2.0 → Provides the high-level functional structure (Identify–Protect–Detect–Respond–Recover).

MITRE ATLAS → Ensures OKRs cover adversarial AI tactics & detection coverage.

SR 11-7 (Model Risk Management) → Anchors goals in model governance and tiering.

DORA (EU Digital Operational Resilience Act) → Emphasizes operational resilience, continuity, and regulatory deadlines.

EU AI Act → Enforces AI risk classification, transparency, and compliance obligations.
